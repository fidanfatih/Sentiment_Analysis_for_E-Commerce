# Sentiment_Analysis_for_E-Commerce
This analysis focuses on using Natural Language techniques to find broad trends in the written thoughts of the customers. The goal in this project is to predict whether customers recommend the product they purchased using the information in their review text.
One of the challenges in this project is to extract useful information from the Review Text variable using text mining techniques. The other challenge is that you need to convert text files into numeric feature vectors to run machine learning algorithms.
In this project, you used Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Ada Boosting Models.
